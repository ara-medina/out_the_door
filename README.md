# Out The Door
in progress: an API built with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL that collects info from users about the objects they carry around with them everyday.

_________________________


Essentially, this project was born out of the assumption that other people are 
as nosy as I am and that they like getting a glimpse of what others are carrying 
around with them everyday. If my friend pulls out her makeup bag, I’ll always 
lean over and ask if I can snoop through it. Knowing what sorts of things people 
surround themselves with makes me feel like I know them a little better and have 
some insight into their daily rituals and routines.


Out The Door is a way to share what the best products are and why we won’t leave 
the house without them. It’s also a way to give others more context about 
ourselves - each post gives you the option of (but doesn’t require) including 
information about yourself, such as age and profession.


This project is also an opportunity for people to show the things they bring with 
them everyday that are less glamorous. If you feel like you need to carry around 
pepper spray because you don’t feel safe in your neighborhood, or if you have an 
invisible disability that means you can’t leave the house without something, 
then you’re invited to share those things too. Eventually, data from Out The Door 
can be used to get a better understanding of what makes people feel comfortable
walking out into the world and whether this changes based on socioeconomic factors.
